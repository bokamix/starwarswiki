This is a recruitment task for the company  Mirumee Software created by Wojciech Janiak @2019

# My comments
I download the planet data separately, because it was specified in the task.
For efficiency, it would be better to download all the planets on one query and then filter them.
"The planets for a specific movie should be fetched when we expand the movie details, not on initial app load."
In app.js I download a list of movies, I put there the function of adding movies.
To styling project i used styled-component and normal css file. 

GraphQL
To connect with data i used swapmi npm api. 
I tried to download data via GraphQL. Unfortunately, the GraphQL api is probably misconfigured and forwards access denied.

I tried to work around the errors through Heroku app. 

The project is available at the addresses.
